        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Jimmy's reptiles is an online store for exotic reptiles. The store has been around for many years dealing with ball pythons, boas, Bearded Dragons and other exotic animals. The business started in January of 1995 where Jimmy found not only a passioin for animals but a passion for reptiles. During his college years Jimmy decided to take his passions for reptiles more serious and invested in his first ball python breeding setup. After that the rest was history. Thank you for shopping with Jimmy's Reptiles.
