        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Jimmy's reptiles is an online store for exotic reptiles. The store has been around for many years dealing with ball pythons, boas, Bearded Dragons and other exotic animals. The business started in January of 1995 where Jimmy found not only a passioin for animals but a passion for reptiles. During his college years Jimmy decided to take his passions for reptiles more serious and invested in his first ball python breeding setup. After that the rest was history. Thank you for shopping with Jimmy's Reptiles.

        <p>humour and the like). It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content
        of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
        of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
        publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
        ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
        by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
